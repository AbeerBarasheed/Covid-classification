Here is an overview of the project
Data Description:
You are provided with a training set and a test set of images of 3 classes. Each image has a filename that is its
unique id.
The dataset comprises 3 classes: COVID-19, Viral Pneumonia, and Normal. The goal of the project is
to create a classifier capable of determining the class of the X-ray image.
Dataset:
The project is inspired from a dataset from Kaggle.
Note: For project purposes, the dataset is modified according to the learning requirements.
You are provided with the following files:
 testimage.npy
 testLabels.csv
 trainimage.npy
 trainLabels.csv
The dataset (above 4 files) has to be downloaded from Olympus platform of Great Learning.
Context:
 Can you differentiate an X-ray image of a normal person from an unhealthy one?
 The ability to do so effectively can mean better diagnosis.
Objective:
 To implement the techniques learnt as a part of the course.
Learning Outcomes:
 Pre-processing of image data.
 Visualization of images.
 Building CNN.
 Evaluate the Model.
